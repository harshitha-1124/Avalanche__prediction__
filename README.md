# ❄️ Avalanche Prediction using Random Forest

> A machine learning-based project to predict the likelihood of avalanches using environmental and meteorological data. Built with Python and Random Forest Classifier for accurate and interpretable predictions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Avalanches are a serious natural hazard in mountainous regions. This project leverages machine learning to predict avalanche occurrences based on historical data such as temperature, snow depth, wind speed, and humidity. The aim is to assist rescue teams and mountain authorities in proactive planning and risk reduction.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Accurately predicting the risk of an avalanche can save lives and reduce damage. Traditional forecasting methods can be slow or unreliable. This project provides a data-driven approach using a trained **Random Forest** model to classify the probability of an avalanche event.
